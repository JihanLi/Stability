1. Introduction
	1.1 problem statement
		how to measure the susceptibility of a social network
	1.2 why important
		1.2.1 help to monitor and improve the stability of society, organization
		1.2.2 understand the assimilation phenomenon of society
		1.2.3 gain more insight into the structure and dynamics of social network
	1.3 general ideas and assumptions
		we considered the signed undirected graph
		data: simulated and real
		how we define susceptibility and balance ratio: we only consider adding new nodes
		the variables of new clique
		the update rules
